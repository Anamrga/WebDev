    <h2>About</h2>
    <hr>


    <p>6 years of experience in the field of industrial design. Self-taught and highly adaptable to new tools.</p>

    <p>Extensive experience in prototyping. I initially started as a CAD Designer and Project Engineer at Baepack, where
        I
        participated in the conceptualization, development (using Solidworks) of various cardboard and plastic packaging
        machines. Depending on the product, the machine processes involved pneumatics, electric axes, or simply folded
        shafts (e.g., for folding the cardboard).</p>

    <p>I was also responsible for organizing and distributing this work for both external and internal production at the
        factory. And with experience in overcoming the challenge of adapting the machine to last-minute client demands
        and product
        materials.</p>

    <p>As for adapting to new tools, I am highly flexible. For instance, at Mecondielle, I had to learn how to operate
        the
        CNC machine, and at Baepack, I also needed to learn how to operate the 3D printer for testing purposes.
        Additionally, since we were a small team, I also learned video and foto editing and photography for advertising
        purposes.</p>

    <p>I have started learning Figma, HTML, CSS, and Python on my own to acquire new skills and collaborate on my first
        website - <a href="https://academiadecapoeira.pt/">Academia de Capoeira de Lisboa</a></p>

    <p>Being self-taught in these areas has allowed me to explore and expand my knowledge in design, web development,
        and
        programming.
    </p>

    <p>While the learning process has its challenges, I have found immense satisfaction in acquiring these skills
        independently. It has given me the freedom to set my own pace, delve deeper into areas that interest me the
        most,
        and experiment with different projects and ideas.</p>

    <p>I am eager to take on new challenges and acquire additional skills.</p>
